# CircularBuffer

CircularBuffer provides a general-purpose CircularBuffer data structure.

Docs: [https://hexdocs.pm/circular_buffer](https://hexdocs.pm/circular_buffer).

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:circular_buffer, "~> 0.4"}
  ]
end
```

## Should I use this?

The entire codebase is less than 50 lines of code and has been tested using
property based testing. I believe the implementation is sound but it may not
be the highest performance library out there.
